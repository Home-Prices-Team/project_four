* **Objectives**
  * Develop a predictive model for accurately forecasting housing prices.
    * Investigate: Can we create a reliable model to predict future home prices with precision?
  * Provide visualizations for what our training data looks like showing Real Estate market trends and outcomes over time using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.
  * Compile an extensive set of features to strengthen our `Home Sales Price Prediction Model`. This project leverages Redfin real estate data and Freddie Mac mortgage rates to analyze and anticipate home prices.
